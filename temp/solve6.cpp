/* Problem B. Array K-Coloring
*****
In you have difficulties with the statement, read the formal requirements. Given a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find any such c_1, c_2, ..., c_n that: 
1) For each i: 1<=c_i<=k 
2) Each value from 1 to k occurs in the array c at least once 
3) For each i from 1 to k all a_j such that c_j=i and distinct (different). In other words, if c_i=c_j and i!=j then a_i!=a_j. */
